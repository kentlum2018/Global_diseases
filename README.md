# Global_diseases
Proposal:
Question:
Does the expanding temperate zone (global warming) influence the occurrence of tropical diseases? These diseases historically have been isolated to specific latitudes. 

Approach:
Using historical data we will extract temperatures, latitudes, infection counts to determine if there is any correlation.
